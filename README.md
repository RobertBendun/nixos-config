# NixOS config

Collection of files used to configure my NixOS + XMonad setup on Thinkpad x270.

## Why this repo is archived?

Due to trouble with Python packages, I sadly consider this distro not for me. Creating Nix config file for each programming project and file is too much additional work without any gain for me.
